# Issues

the upload option not work if the size of file is > 7000 because http hardcoded not work with chunk, on havoc 0.6 I work on this

# TODO

TODO of the project

- Implement python support ( ex: pyload cme.py <args> )
- Implement shared library injection to migrate process
- Better compilation using havoc
- Update shell command to execute async
- Create "job" command equals demon job
- Implement time to exec, ex: run_time 2020/02/02:10.05 rm -rf /
- Configure compilation to compile for macos and android
- Automatic agent update ( optional )
